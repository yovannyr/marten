So far, Marten has diagnostics, command logging, and unit of work lifecycle tracking.

For information on accessing and previewing the database schema objects generated by Marten, see <[linkto:documentation/schema]>


## Listening for Document Store Events

**All of the functionality in this section was added as part of Marten v0.8**

Marten has a facility for listening and even intercepting document persistence events with the `IDocumentSessionListener` interface:

<[sample:IDocumentSessionListener]>

You can build and inject your own listeners by adding them to the `StoreOptions` object you use to configure a `DocumentStore`:

<[sample:registering-a-document-session-listener]>

The listeners can be used to modify an `IDocumentSession` and its related unit of work just before persisting. Marten itself will be using this mechanism
internally to perform projections in the future. 

The following fake, sample listener demonstrates how you can query into the pending changes before making a transactional commit, and also how to
query what was done after a commit is made:

<[sample:writing_custom_session_listener]>

As of Marten 1.4, you can also register `IDocumentSessionListener` objects scoped to a particular session with the 
`DocumentStore.OpenSession(SessionOptions)` signature.


## Custom Logging

Marten v0.8 comes with a new mechanism to plug in custom logging to the `IDocumentStore`, `IQuerySession`, and `IDocumentSession` activity:

<[sample:IMartenLogger]>

To apply these logging abstractions, you can either plug your own `IMartenLogger` into the `StoreOptions` object and allow that default logger to create the individual session loggers:

<[sample:plugging-in-marten-logger]>

You can also directly apply a session logger to any `IQuerySession` or `IDocumentSession` like this:

<[sample:plugging-in-session-logger]>

The session logging is a different abstraction specifically so that you _could_ track database commands issued per session. In effect, my own shop is going to use this capability to understand what HTTP endpoints or service bus message handlers are being unnecessarily chatty in their database interactions. We also hope that the contextual logging of commands per document session makes it easier to understand how our systems behave.

<[sample:ConsoleMartenLogger]>


## Accessing Diagnostics

All the diagnostics are going to be exposed off of the `IDocumentStore.Diagnostics` property. Today, the only capabilities are to get a preview of the generated storage code or a preview of the ADO.Net code that will be generated for a Linq query.

## Previewing Linq Queries

Let's say that we have a small document type called `Trade`:

<[sample:trade_document_type]>

The `[DuplicateField]` attribute directs Marten to duplicate the value of `Value` into a separate database field for more efficient querying. Now, let's say that we want to search for every `Trade` document with a value of over 2,000, but we want to see the SQL query that Marten will build for that query first:

<[sample:preview_linq_command]>

The sql string in our debug window for the code above is:

<pre>
select d.data from mt_doc_trade as d where d.value > :arg0
</pre>

## Previewing the Postgresql Query Plan

Marten has a helper to find and preview the [Postgresql EXPLAIN plan](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/using-explain.html) for a Linq query. Our hope is that this will be a valuable aid to teams who need face performance problems while using Marten. The syntax for fetching the EXPLAIN plan for the Linq query from the previous section is shown below:

<[sample:preview_linq_explain_plan]>

The console output for the code below (on my box) was:

<pre>
NodeType: Seq Scan
RelationName: mt_doc_trade
Alias: d
StartupCost: 0
TotalCost: 24.13
PlanRows: 377
PlanWidth: 36
</pre>


## Request Counting and Thresholds

Marten has several facilities for improving system performance by reducing the number of network round trips to the server, but the first step maybe to
just understand what kinds of operations are being chatty in the first place. To that end, Marten exposes the request count for each `IQuerySession` or `IDocumentSession` that simply tells you how many commands have been issued to Postgresql by that session:

<[sample:using_request_count]>

At this point, Marten does not have any built in support for asserting requests per session thresholds like other tools. While I think that we are uncomfortable with that functionality ever being turned on in production, it should be easily feasible to build those kinds of automated threshold testing like "fail the test if there were more than 25 requests issued for any given HTTP request."
